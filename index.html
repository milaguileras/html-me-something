              <p>If you're climber and you haven't heard of the Natural's state climbing scene, you need to double check your credentials.
                  Even when other places are covered in snow and offering ice climbing for the season(I'm looking at you, South Dakota!), Arkansas 
                  still allows for somewhat mild weather and exceptional climbing. In this article we hope to put together a small guide with the
                  most visited outdoor climbing spots in Northwest Arkansas. &nbsp

                <img src='images/horseShoe.jpg' alt="woman climbing" class="center" width="500" height="500">

                <p>Horseshoe Canyon is a family owned ranch with a plethora of activities including ziplines, horseback riding, and climbing some of the finest sandstone routes.
                  It has over 400 climbing spots between routes and boulders. The majority of the routes are fully bolted, but there are also many fine trad routes to explore.
                  There is a $10 fee to Climb, and $5 fee to camp. During peak season, you might want to set up your tent early on the weekend in order to pick a good stop. 
                  The money goes towards maintaining the bolts, which staff is constantly checking, as well as providing clean bathrooms with showers.
                  If you are feeling fancy, they also rent out cabins.

              <p>Lincoln Lake is located 30 minutes outside of Fayeteville, and a great spot for beginners and intermediate climbers.
                  With lots of hiking trails, most of the climbing routes are by the lake, which allows for incredible views. Kayaking and Stand Up Paddling are
                  also really popular activities there. Dogs are allowed on the trails, which is also a great plus.
